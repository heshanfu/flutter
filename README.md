# üWave for Android

A [Flutter](https://flutter.io) and [NewPipe](https://newpipe.schabi.org) based client for [üWave](https://u-wave.net)!

Note that while it uses Flutter, it's not cross platform. Only Android is supported.

At some point this will be posted to the F-Droid app store. Because we're using NewPipe, the Play Store is not an option :)
